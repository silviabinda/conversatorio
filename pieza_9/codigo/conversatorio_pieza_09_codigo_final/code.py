Conversatorio, artwork 9
by Silvia Binda Heiserova, 2023

About Conversatorio:
Conversatorio is a series of feminist electronic and digital artworks, using various components, microcontrollers, modules and code. It includes a series of 8 boars, conceptualized as open hardware artistic feminist devices, designed and assembled in such manner so they uncover what usually is hidden. These boards are open source and transparent, all its components are visible so everybody can see what these technologies consists of.
Beside calling for openism and transparency, the boards from Conservatorio series are determined by the number 78:

In 2023, up until today, September 15th, 78 women were assassinated in Spain for mysoginistic and sexist motives (data source: feminicidio.net).
Every board from Conversatorio is coded so that it visually or sonically represents the number of these hate crimes, which in Spanish language are called "feminicidios".
Alltogether, when entering the space of the open hardware boards ensamblage, visitors find themselves encircled by seemingly unpredictable soundscapes that are predetermined by data representing gender violance in its worst consequences. Simultaneously, the number 78 is visualised in subtle and almost invisible way, just like gender violance is persisting in our day to day lived societies throughout the year.

About artwork 9:
The last artwork from Conversatorio derives from our concern about the relation between feminism, gender and technology. After being overwhelmed and saturated with passing by the electronic, sonic and visual interpretation of gender violence statistics, we end up on exploring the human - machine relation through an impossible conversation about feminism.
This artwork is an ensamblage of 6 RGB LED Matrices that visualize a human - machine conversation about the current state of feminism. The composition of the LED Matrices as well as the behaviour of the text make its reading impossible. The text written in natural language is being constantly overlapped by the text written in programming language, specifically the same code written here that was used to visualize the natural language text.
